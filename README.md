# Movie app fullstack

## Overview

A movie web app created with react.js as a frontend and java - spring boot as a backend.

## About the project

- In the current version, there are three movie stories; the user can:

- **Get all popular movies:** [pagination exists in the created API]. The user would go to localhost:3000/movies to see all the popular movies. Each page contains 20 movies and there are arrow buttons to make the user move around from one page to another.
- **Search for any movie:** there is a search bar at the home page that the user can use to search for a specific movie. The user has to add at least 3 characters to initiate the search.
- **Get the movie details:**. If a user wants to see more information about a movie, all he has to do is to click on the movie card on the home page.

### Next version

- **More movie details**. The user would be able to watch the movie, download it, and rate it.
- **Get all movies of certain category**. The user would be able to search for a genre in the search bar to get all the movies related to the input genre.
